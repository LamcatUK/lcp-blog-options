# LC Blog Options WordPress Plugin

A WordPress plugin that provides granular control over blog functionality, allowing administrators to disable blog features, comments, and gravatars through a simple admin interface.

The plugin also forces Advanced Custom Fields blocks to stay in edit mode in the block editor, including immediately after a new block is inserted, and adds a branded Lamcat dashboard widget.

## Features

  - Hides Posts menu from admin
  - Prevents access to post-related admin pages
  - Removes blog-related dashboard widgets
  - Disables post type support
  - Automatically disables comments and gravatars

- **Disable Comments**: Removes comment functionality including:
  - Closes comments on all posts
  - Hides existing comments
  - Removes Comments menu from admin
  - Removes comment-related dashboard widgets
  - Hides discussion settings page

- **Disable Gravatars**: Disables avatar/gravatar functionality:
  - Turns off gravatar display
  - Removes avatar options from user profiles

- **Lamcat Dashboard Widget**: Adds a branded admin dashboard widget with quick contact details

- **Force ACF Block Edit Mode**: Keeps all ACF blocks in edit mode in the block editor, including newly inserted blocks

## Installation

1. Upload the `lcp-blog-options` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to Tools > LC Blog Options to configure settings

## Usage

### Admin Interface

The plugin adds a "LC Blog Options" page under the WordPress admin Tools menu. This page contains five checkboxes:

1. **Disable Blog** - When checked, completely disables all blog functionality and automatically enables options 2, 3, and 4
2. **Disable Comments** - When checked, disables all comment-related functionality
3. **Disable Gravatars** - When checked, disables gravatar/avatar display
4. **Disable Tags** - When checked, removes post tags from the admin UI
5. **Disable Emojis** - When checked, removes WordPress emoji assets and TinyMCE emoji support

### Checkbox Behavior

- When "Disable Blog" is checked, "Disable Comments", "Disable Gravatars", and "Disable Tags" are automatically checked and cannot be unchecked
